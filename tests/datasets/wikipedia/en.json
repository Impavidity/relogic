{"id": 712697, "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolar_proteinosis", "title": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis", "text": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of surfactant-derived lipoprotein compounds within the alveoli of the lung. The accumulated substances interfere with the normal gas exchange and expansion of the lungs, ultimately leading to difficulty breathing and a predisposition to developing lung infections. The causes of PAP may be grouped into primary and secondary causes, although the most common cause is a primary autoimmune condition.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of PAP include shortness of breath, a cough, low grade fever, and weight loss.\nThe clinical course of PAP is unpredictable. Spontaneous remission is recognized, and some patients have stable symptoms. Death may occur due to the progression of PAP or of any underlying associated disease. Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to lung infections such as bacterial pneumonia, mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection, or a fungal infection.\nCauses.\nThe abnormal accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds in PAP is due to impaired surfactant regulation and clearance. This is usually related to impaired alveolar macrophage function.\nIn adults, the most common cause of PAP is an autoimmunity to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a critical factor in development of alveolar macrophages. Decreased bioavailability of GM-CSF results in poor alveolar macrophages development and function, which results in accumulation of surfactant and related products.\nSecondary causes of PAP are those in which the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds is secondary to another disease process. This has been recognized in the settings of certain cancers (such as myeloid leukemia), lung infections, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals.\nAlthough the cause of PAP was not originally understood, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the cause of the disease came by the chance observation that mice bred for experimental study to lack a hematologic growth factor known as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) developed a pulmonary syndrome of abnormal surfactant accumulation resembling human PAP.\nThe implications of this finding are still being explored, but significant progress was reported in February 2007. Researchers in that report discussed the presence of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies in patients with PAP, and duplicated that syndrome with the infusion of these autoantibodies into mice.\nFamilial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental \"GATA2\" genes produces an autosomal dominant disorder termed GATA2 deficiency. The \"GATA2\" gene produces the GATA2 transcription factor which is critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming cells. Individuals with a single \"GATA2\" inactivating mutation present with a wide range of disorders including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. \"GATA2\" mutation-based pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with normal levels of GM-CSF and commonly improves or is avoided in afflicted individuals who successfully receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\nGenetics.\nAbnormalities in CSF2 receptor alpha have been shown to cause hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. This gene is located on chromosome 5 in the 5q31 region. This gene product is also known as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of PAP is made using a combination of a person's symptoms, chest imaging, and microscopic evaluation of lung washing/tissue. Additional testing for serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies are helpful for confirmation.\nAlthough both the symptoms and imaging findings are stereotypical and well-described, they are non-specific and indistinguishable from many other conditions. For example, chest x-ray may show alveolar opacities, and a CT may show a \"crazy paving\" lung pattern, both of which are seen more commonly in numerous other conditions. Thus, the diagnosis primarily depends on the pathology findings.\nLung washings or tissue for histopathologic analysis are most commonly obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy. Characteristic biopsy findings show filling of the alveoli (and sometimes terminal bronchioles) with an amorphous eosinophilic material, which stains strongly positive on PAS stain and the PAS diastase stain. The surrounding alveoli and pulmonary interstitium remain relatively normal. Electron microscopy of the sample, although not typically performed due to impracticality, shows lamellated bodies representing surfactant. An alternative diagnosis with similar histomorphologic findings is \"Pneumocystis jirovicii\" pneumonia.\nLung washings characteristically yield a fluid which is \"milky\"composition. Under the microscope, samples show 20-50 micrometer PAS-positive globules on a background of finely granular or amorphous PAS-positive material. There is typically a low numbers of macrophages and inflammatory cells (although this is variable).\nTreatment.\nThe standard treatment for PAP is whole-lung lavage, in which the lung is filled with sterile fluid with subsequent removal of the fluid along with the abnormal surfactant material. This is generally effective at improving PAP symptoms, often for a prolonged period of time.\nSince the mouse discovery noted above, the use of GM-CSF injections has also been attempted, with variable success.\nLung transplantation may be performed in refractory cases.\nEpidemiology.\nThe disease is more common in males and in tobacco smokers.\nIn a recent epidemiologic study from Japan, Autoimmune PAP has an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and is not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses.\nEndogenous lipoid pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis has been seen prior to the development of PAP in a child.\nHistory.\nPAP was first described in 1958 by the physicians Samuel Rosen, Benjamin Castleman, and Averill Liebow. In their case series published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" on June 7 of that year, they described 27 patients with pathologic evidence of periodic acid Schiff positive material filling the alveoli. This lipid rich material was subsequently recognized to be surfactant.\nThe reported treatment of PAP using therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage was in 1960 by Dr. Jose Ramirez-Rivera at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Baltimore, who described repeated \"segmental flooding\" as a means of physically removing the accumulated alveolar material.\nResearch.\nPAP is one of the rare lung diseases currently being studied by The Rare Lung Diseases Consortium (RLDC). The RLDC is part of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN), an initiative of the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR), of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The RLDC is dedicated to developing new diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with rare lung diseases, through collaboration between the National Institutes of Health, patient organizations and clinical investigators.\nPatient registry.\nPAP patients, families, and caregivers are encouraged to join the.

{"id": 712713, "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautoka", "title": "Lautoka", "text": "Lautoka.\nLautoka is the second largest city of Fiji. It is in the west of the island of Viti Levu, 24 kilometres north of Nadi<nowiki/> and port of entry in Fiji, after Suva. Lying in the heart of Fiji's sugar cane-growing region, it is known as the Sugar City. Covering an area of 16 square kilometres, it had a population of 52,220 at the 2007 census, the most recent to date.\nEconomic activities.\nLautoka is known as the \"Sugar City\" because of its sugar cane belt areas. The main Lautoka Sugar Mill was founded in 1903, and is the city's biggest employer by far. Built for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji) (CSR) by workers from India and the Solomon Islands between 1899 and 1903, it hires some 1,300 employees today. Other industries include timber milling, garment manufacturing, distillery, brewery, jewellery, blending, steelworks, fishing, hatchery, domestic items, paints, and construction.\nIn 2012 Lautoka was announced as the administration capital of the western division...\nHistory.\nThe name of the city is derived from two Fijian words meaning \"spear hit.\" According to an oral tradition, the name arose following a duel between two chiefs. As one speared the other, he was reported to have cried \"Lau-toka!\" (\"Bull's eye!\").\nThe first known European sighting of the Lautoka area took place on 7 May 1789. Captain William Bligh spotted and roughly charted the coasts of Lautoka while making his epic voyage to Timor, in the wake of the mutiny on the \"Bounty\".\nPolitics.\nIncorporated as a town in 1929, Lautoka was proclaimed a city on 25 February 1977. It is governed by a 16-member city council, who elect from among themselves a mayor. Lautoka currently does not have a mayor but has a government-appointed administrator like all urban centres in Fiji since the military coup of 2006. The former administrator was Parveen Bala, who was also mayor of Ba.\nA well-known past Mayor is Ratilal Patel, who was elected mayor in 1967.\nLautoka is the only city in Fiji's Western Division, and is the industrial hub of Fiji which contains more than 50 percent of the nation's population. It is also the headquarters of the Fiji Electricity Authority, the Fiji Pine Ltd, and the National Marketing Authority.\nMass media.\nThe headquarters and studios of Mix FM Fiji are located in Lautoka. With National coverage, MixFM is the only English station in Fiji to be based outside of Suva.\nDemography.\nSince 1970, the population of Lautoka has grown rapidly, and in the last twenty years it has also changed dramatically in structure. In the early 1970s the population was estimated to be about 12,000, the vast majority of inhabitants being Indian, as would be expected considering the early growth of the city was entirely associated with the sugar industry. Almost all of the present Indian inhabitants are descendants of the early girmityas. In 1986 the population was 39,000 and in 1996 almost 43,000, but it is not clear exactly how the boundaries of the urban area were defined at either of these censuses. In 2005 the population including the suburban zones was probably about 50,000, occupying a total area of about 16\u00a0km\u00b2. The population of Lautoka including the rural districts is around 80,000. But much of the recent growth of the city itself has been due to indigenous Fijians moving into the urban area.\nThe city is the birthplace of PGA Tour Hall of Famer Vijay Singh and Ghazal and Tabla star Cassius Khan.\nTransport.\nPort of Lautoka is the main maritime gateway for western Viti Levu and is the second largest port in Fiji. The port is mainly used for bulk sugar, molasses, woodchips, petroleum and gas. The port is also used for cruises, Blue Lagoon Cruises and Nai's Cruises are based here.\nLautoka is served by Pacific Transport and Sunbeam buses. Pacific Transport connects Lautoka directly to Nadi Intl Airport and Ba. Sunbeam runs 8 times daily Queen's Highway Service, linking Lautoka to Suva with stops at Nadi International Airport, Nadi Town, Fijian (Shangri \u2013 La) Resort, Sigatoka Town, Abua Sands, Hideaway Resort, Naviti Resort, Korolevu, Warwick Resorts, Beach House, Crusoes Retreat Junction, Deuba Inn and Tradewinds Lami.", "annotations": [{"uri": "Local_government_in_Fiji", "surface_form": "city", "offset": 39}, {"uri": "Fiji", "surface_form": "Fiji", "offset": 47}, {"uri": "Viti_Levu", "surface_form": "Viti Levu", "offset": 88}, {"uri": "Nadi", "surface_form": "Nadi", "offset": 122}, {"uri": "Sugar_cane", "surface_form": "sugar cane", "offset": 204}, {"uri": "Lautoka_Sugar_Mill", "surface_form": "Lautoka Sugar Mill", "offset": 484}, {"uri": "Colonial_Sugar_Refining_Company_(Fiji)", "surface_form": "Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)", "offset": 581}, {"uri": "India", "surface_form": "India", "offset": 642}, {"uri": "Solomon_Islands", "surface_form": "Solomon Islands", "offset": 656}, {"uri": "Fijian_language", "surface_form": "Fijian", "offset": 1048}, {"uri": "Ratu", "surface_form": "chiefs", "offset": 1158}, {"uri": "William_Bligh", "surface_form": "William Bligh", "offset": 1339}, {"uri": "Timor", "surface_form": "Timor", "offset": 1435}, {"uri": "Mutiny_on_the_Bounty", "surface_form": "mutiny on the \"Bounty\"", "offset": 1461}, {"uri": "Lautoka_City_Council", "surface_form": "city council", "offset": 1608}, {"uri": "2006_Fijian_coup_d'\u00e9tat", "surface_form": "military coup", "offset": 1789}, {"uri": "Parveen_Bala", "surface_form": "Parveen Bala", "offset": 1841}, {"uri": "Ba_(town)", "surface_form": "Ba", "offset": 1877}, {"uri": "Ratilal_Patel", "surface_form": "Ratilal Patel", "offset": 1908}, {"uri": "Western_Division,_Fiji", "surface_form": "Western Division", "offset": 1989}, {"uri": "Fiji_Electricity_Authority", "surface_form": "Fiji Electricity Authority", "offset": 2140}, {"uri": "Fiji_Pine_Ltd", "surface_form": "Fiji Pine Ltd", "offset": 2172}, {"uri": "National_Marketing_Authority", "surface_form": "National Marketing Authority", "offset": 2195}, {"uri": "Mix_FM_Fiji", "surface_form": "Mix FM Fiji", "offset": 2269}, {"uri": "Indians_in_Fiji", "surface_form": "Indian", "offset": 2652}, {"uri": "Girmityas", "surface_form": "girmityas", "offset": 2845}, {"uri": "PGA_Tour", "surface_form": "PGA Tour", "offset": 3359}, {"uri": "World_Golf_Hall_of_Fame", "surface_form": "Hall of Famer", "offset": 3368}, {"uri": "Vijay_Singh", "surface_form": "Vijay Singh", "offset": 3382}, {"uri": "Cassius_Khan", "surface_form": "Cassius Khan", "offset": 3420}, {"uri": "Nadi_International_Airport", "surface_form": "Nadi Intl Airport", "offset": 3826}, {"uri": "Ba_(town)", "surface_form": "Ba", "offset": 3848}, {"uri": "Suva", "surface_form": "Suva", "offset": 3923}, {"uri": "Nadi_International_Airport", "surface_form": "Nadi International Airport", "offset": 3942}, {"uri": "Nadi", "surface_form": "Nadi Town", "offset": 3970}, {"uri": "Sigatoka", "surface_form": "Sigatoka Town", "offset": 4011}]}
